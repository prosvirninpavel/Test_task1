I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So, who the hell are you to save me?
I never would have made it, babe

If you needed love
Well, then, ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word.

Bring It On 1
